                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Nowadays, the world has changed the way it works. The Internet has revolutionized our lifestyle and most of our lives are spent on the web.
                        Being a student who wants to build up a career ahead is quite challenging in this competitive era and it requires exceptional capabilities to stand out.
                        <br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;Long story short, we all need to have a website where you could present yourself, showcase your skills and work experience to stand out.
                        So, I created one for myself.
                        <br><br>
                        But how?
                        <br> 
                        &emsp;&emsp;That's a good question that popped-up in my  mind when I was initially thinking of it.
                        I had no experience of building websites so I started my study on it. Luckily, Found sufficient helping material and books online to get guidance from. 
                    </p>
                    <h5>What kind of website should it be?</h5><br>
                    <p>
                        &emsp;&emsp;I had an idea of what it may look like. I went to the drawing sheet and sketched out a few themes and layouts. Started scrolling through royalty free HTML templates 
                        available online to get inspiration from but I barely liked any of them. Finally, I agreed upon a theme created by myself.
                        <br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;It took me a few nights and a weekend to teach myself the basics of HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT. I implemented my knowledge and created a test website to see how far I can go on my own and honestly, that was terrible. Yes, it worked but it didn't deserve to be called a good first attempt.
                        The books I've been reading through had some really well written raw blobs of code that I can use. It gave me a well developed foundation to start from.
                    </p>
                    <h5>I had questions... </h5>
                    <p><br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;Throughout the process, I had a lot of questions in my mind.<br>
                        <li>Would I really be able to finish it?</li><br>
                        <li>Wouldn't I waste a lot of my time with no outcome?</li><br>
                        <li>Would it be helpful enough?</li><br>
                        <li>Shouldn't I pay someone to build me one? </li><br>
                        <li>How does a noobs website look like?</li><br>
                        <li>How responsive would it be?</li><br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &emsp;&emsp;And at a point, I was like " I must do it and just don't care how terrible it turns out. I'd be proud of the time I wasted". And that answered almost all of my questions.
                        I don't care for appreciation and this is something worth doing for me.....<br>
                        All this added up to enough motivation for me to continue working.<br>
                        Actually, I was a little inspired by one of my Teachers who was used to say :
                    </p>
                    <h6>
                        &emsp;&emsp;"You should be able to implement your programming skills in any language you don't even know of".
                    </h6>
                    <p>
                        So that's how it works.
                        <br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;I kept moulding the code into the desired theme. I created the homepage index.html file and linked the CSS classes to it. Created sections, defined fonts, added rows and a lot else....<br>
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        My Way of Working...
                    </h5>
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;
                        I was working on HTML, CSS for the first time so If I came up with a problem, I didn't really know how to fix it.
                        <br>
                        The fact I'm proud of is that I do not rely on YouTube tutorials and videos. Instead, I read the documentation and resources Available on that topic.
                        This helps me save a lot of time and I really learn something instead of just following someone else's way of doing it.
                        I spent a few hours each day, some more hours on weekends and finally, I have a website that looks and feels quite promising to me.
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        Challenges that had me stuck...
                    </h5>
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;
                        There were a lot of stages where I felt stuck and literally didn't know how to fix it.
                        Just like if I changed the header of the page and updated the site, turned out it messed up the entire frame resulting in weird looking dimensions of sections.
                        <br>&emsp;&emsp;But the most challenging time I had was to optimize the website for both Desktop and Mobile at the same time.
                        The CSS should be able to adjust it's size and orientation after detecting the size of the target device.
                        <br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;This problem took a lot of time and I fixed it upto quite a margin. Still slight imperfections that I'm working on. 
                        <br>
                        Lastly, I added some JavaScript classes to animate the pages as you scroll down.
                        "For now, animation works only for desktop browsers".
                        <br>I still keep improving tiny bits of it over the weekends.
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        Where to host the website?
                    </h5>
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;
                        At the moment, I'm not ready to find out best hosting service and website is still under testing and modifications, I decided to host it on a free and highly flexible platform <mark>GitHub.io</mark> 
                        I was quite familiar with it so I didn't bother about other options. I have the flexibility to move it to Hostinger, Blue host etc. They're dirt cheap and super easy to use but that's a story for another time.
                    </p>
                    <h5>
                        Did I just open sourced my website?
                    </h5>
                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;
                        Unintentionally but yes I did. The platform I host it of is open source and it makes the source files accessible to anyone to Download and use. Well, I have no issues with it. You can give it a try.
                        <br>
                        That was the journey from<mark>"I have no website"</mark> to <mark>"I have a website"</mark>.
                        <br>I'm proud of the night hours and weekends I spent on it and I must say It's worth it.
